# Public Permissioned Decentralized Applications

This repository contains the code and related materials for my Master's thesis on Public Permissioned Decentralized Applications using Verifiable Credentials (VC) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). The aim of this project is to develop a secure, transparent, and privacy-preserving architecture for decentralized applications (dApps) on public blockchains.

## Overview

The thesis integrates several key technologies to address the challenges associated with off-chain verification services in a trustless system. The main components of the architecture include:

1. **Blockchain Technology**: Ensures transparency and immutability.
2. **Access Control Models**: Manages user permissions and access rights.
3. **Verifiable Off-chain Computation (VOC) and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**: Facilitates privacy-preserving verification of user attributes.
4. **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)**: Empowers users with full control over their identity data.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `smart_contracts/`: Contains the implementation code for the proposed system.
- `benchmark/`: Scripts and data for the experiments conducted in the thesis.
- `zokrates-kit/`: No-code solution for creating ZoKrates proving programs.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MikeHerman19/Public-Permissioned-Decentralized-Applications.git
   cd Public-Permissioned-Decentralized-Applications
